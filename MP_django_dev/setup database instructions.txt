---- Setting up the database django will use ----

* Log onto the postgres user with your user ('postgres') and password *

# Extend psql with postgis
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

# Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE django_db;

# Create a user with your own password
# Note: this password will need to be replaced in settings.py in the django application
CREATE USER django_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';

# Setting additional settings
ALTER ROLE django_user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE django_user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE django_user SET timezone TO 'UTC';

# Give the user administrative access to the database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE django_db to django_user;

* You can now exit the psql command line interface (cli)*

## Adjust settings.py so that it has the correct values ##

---- Initializing the database using django ----
